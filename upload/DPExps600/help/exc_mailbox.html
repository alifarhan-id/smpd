by exporting them as PST files. The agent supports full, differential,
copy and incremental backups of selected mailboxes. The mailboxes
can be recovered by merging them back into original mailboxes or by
restoring them to PST files on disk.</p>
	
	<p>The Exchange Mailbox Agent is intended to protect key mailboxes.
 The Mailbox Agent can significantly increase the backup time because
of the inherent processing overhead of Exchange.  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Note"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" height="25" src="images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>NOTE: </b>This method does not replace Exchange Database backups which

	<h2><a name="d0e4980"></a>Configuration</h2><p>The Mailbox Agent is disabled by default. This ensures that
backups don&#8217;t accidentally trigger multiple Exchange backups
via the Exchange Database Agent and the Mailbox Agent. You can enable
the Mailbox Agent by checking Enable Agent on its configuration page.
You should specify a working directory location for Import/Export
operation of mailboxes. The working location defaults to the Product
&#8220;temp&#8221; directory.</p>
	
	<p>Once enabled, the Administrator displays all Mailboxes under
the Exchange Mailbox Agent and makes them selectable for backup.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="d0e4986"></a>Backing Up Mailboxes</h2><p>The Backup process begins by exporting each selected mailbox
as a PST file, one at a time, to the working directory. If sufficient
disk space is not available for the operation in the working location,
the backup fails and displays an error message. After a mailbox file
is backed up, it is removed from the working directory to free up
disk space.</p>
	
	<p>The working directory is not backed up. The user can configure
the location of the working directory on the Agent&#8217;s configuration
page.</p>
	
	<p>You can configure the Mailbox Agent to do full, copy, differential,
or incremental backups of Exchange mailboxes by setting the backup
job Mode.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="d0e4994"></a>Restoring Mailboxes</h2><p>Mailboxes are recovered by restoring them to the working directory,
then importing them to the Exchange Database, merging items with the
original mailbox. Insufficient disk space in the working location
causes the backup to fail and displays an error message. Exchange
Server automatically skips the mailbox items that already exist and
only restores missing items. Once mailbox items are imported to the
mailbox, the temporary PST file is deleted from the working directory.</p>
	
	<p>If you specify a folder name on the Agent&#8217;s configuration
page, the mailbox items will be recovered to this folder in the original
mailbox.</p>
	
	<p>Mailboxes can also be restored to a PST file on the File System.
You can view the contents of the mailbox by using an Exchange client,
such as Microsoft Outlook. This is useful when the Exchange Server
environment is down and unable to host the mailboxes.</p>
	
	<p>Mailboxes must be explicitly selected.  If a user selects an
entire machine for restore, the normal Exchange Mailbox Databases
will be restored, but individual mailboxes will not be restored. Also,
if one or more Exchange Databases are selected for recovery via the
Exchange Server Agent, the restore job skips the mailboxes selected
under the Mailbox Agent, as those will be restored from the Exchange
Database.</p>
	
	<p>Mailboxes that have been deleted from Exchange Server require
you to create the mailbox in the Exchange Server before restoring
the Mailbox items using the Mailbox Agent. A nonexistent mailbox cannot
be restored.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="d0e5006"></a>Disaster Recovery</h2><p>Mailboxes will not be restored during Bare Metal Disaster Recovery.
To restore, create a new restore job after Disaster Recovery completes,
and select the necessary mailboxes to recover. </p>
	
	<h2><a name="d0e5010"></a>Requirements</h2><h3><a name="d0e5012"></a>Working Location</h3><p>A working location must be specified on the Agent&#8217;s configuration
page. This location stores the temporary files generated during mailbox
Import and Export operations. Free space in this location must be
at least the size of the largest Mailbox in the Exchange Server. Once
each operation completes, the temporary file is automatically deleted.</p>
	
	<p>&#8220;Exchange Trusted Subsystem&#8221; must have Read/Write
permissions to the working directory.</p>
	
	<p>The working location defaults to Product &#8220;temp&#8221;
directory. </p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e5020"></a>Supported Exchange Server versions</h3><p>Exchange Server 2010 SP1 is the minimum supported version. </p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e5024"></a>Mailbox Permissions</h3><p>An Active Directory User or a Group must be granted &#8220;Mailbox
Import Export&#8221; role. Typically, running as Administrator, the
product service already has necessary permissions for the mailboxes.</p>
	
	<p>To manually grant this role, execute the following cmdlet in
the Exchange Management Shell</p>
	
	<div class="example"><a name="d0e5030"></a><p class="title"><b>New-ManagementRoleAssignment &#8211;Role &#8220;Mailbox Import
Export&#8221; &#8211;User Domain\User</b></p></div><p>Where, Domain is the Active Directory Domain name and User is
the account granted permissions.</p>
	
	<p>To grant necessary permissions to a group use:</p>
	
	<div class="example"><a name="d0e5037"></a><p class="title"><b>New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Role "Mailbox Import Export"
-Name "Import Export Mailbox Admins" -SecurityGroup "Mailbox Support" </b></p></div><h3><a name="d0e5040"></a>PowerShell Access</h3><p>If the product service is running under an account that does
not have access to PowerShell, you need to specify a valid account
with permission to execute PowerShell cmdlets. Typically, running
as the default, Local System account, the product service automatically
has access to PowerShell.</p>
	
	<h4><a name="d0e5044"></a>Best Practices and Performance Considerations</h4><p>You should perform frequent incremental backups of Exchange
mailboxes in addition to full backups. Daily incremental backups followed
by weekly full backups will reduce the recovery time and the backup
size. Incremental backups also enable you to conveniently specify
a restore window to recover mailbox items. </p>
	
	<p>Consider the case where you wish to recover a few deleted messages
from your inbox after the retention period has expired on the Exchange
Server. If you know the date the original emails were sent or received,
you can be back in action within seconds of running the mailbox restore.
However, if you only had full backups of the mailbox, you would be
forced to restore the entire mailbox, whose size could run to several
gigabytes, so it would require a much longer restore time.</p>
	
	<p>Backup performance is dependent on a number of factors including
but not limited to: </p>
	
	<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Mailboxes in the Exchange Sever</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Count of mail items in each mailbox</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Type of Backup (Full, Copy, Differential, Incremental)</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Hardware powering the Exchange Server deployment</p>
	
	</li></ol></div><p>There are no special requirements to improve backup performance
of the Mailbox Agent. However, backup performance can be optimized
by selecting only essential mailboxes from the Agent and performing
incremental backups on a regular basis.</p>
