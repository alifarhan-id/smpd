policies. Retention policies allow you to balance your data protection
and historical retention needs with the economic realities of media
material and management costs.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="media_set"></a>Media Sets</h2><p>Data Protector Express organizes media into
sets based on the rotation type and schedule interval. Whether the
job requires several or only one physical media to complete, they
are identified in the Data Protector Express catalog
as a set. When more than one physical media is required for a job, Data Protector Express will create a unique name for each media
in the set.</p>
	
	<p>When planning scheduled backup jobs, it is important to know
whether one or several physical media will be required to complete
a backup job. This can usually be estimated by comparing the size
of the backup selection to the capacity of the selected media. If
you do not want Data Protector Express to use more
than one media for a backup job, then you must select fewer files
to back up.</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Note"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Note]" height="25" src="images/note.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>NOTE: </b>The terms media can be used to refer to both physical media,

	<h2><a name="rotation_intervals"></a>Intervals</h2><p>Job schedules are defined using the Intervals <span><strong class="guilabel">Daily</strong></span>, <span><strong class="guilabel">Weekly</strong></span>, <span><strong class="guilabel">Monthly</strong></span>, and <span><strong class="guilabel">Yearly</strong></span>. Intervals are used to defined which days a job
will run, what type of backup (full, incremental, differential, or
copy) will be done, and how many sets of media are dedicated to the
interval. The size of an interval refers to the amount of time between
runs of that interval. </p>
	
	<p>When the <span><strong class="guilabel">Run repeatedly</strong></span> schedule type is
chosen the job <span><strong class="guilabel">Configuration</strong></span> page will show an
additional section, <span><strong class="guilabel">Interval settings</strong></span>, that control
the schedule parameters. Each interval type is listed along with a
textual description of its current setting. To customize the settings
for an interval , click on one of the interval buttons. Most schedules
are defined in terms of the following intervals:</p>
	
	<p><b>Daily  &nbsp;</b>&#8212; run on sequential weekdays. </p>
	
	<p><b>Weekly  &nbsp;</b>&#8212; run once per week on the day specified by the user,
for example, Friday.</p>
	
	<p><b>Monthly  &nbsp;</b>&#8212; run once per month on a day specified by the user such
as the first day, the last day, the first Monday, and others. You
can also specify how many months should elapse between monthlies.
Setting the monthly interval to every 3 months will create a backup
every quarter.</p>
	
	<p><b>Yearly  &nbsp;</b>&#8212; run once per year on a specified day of the year. By
increasing the interval you can also schedule a job to run once every
so many years.</p>

that are less commonly used. The concepts behind using them are similar
to those of the intervals discussed above.</p><p>For all intervals there is a setting that controls the number
of sets. This settings determines how many sets of that backup interval
will be created before Data Protector Express goes
back and overwrites the first. For example, if your schedule starts
in January and calls for three monthly sets, you will have a set for
January, a set for February, and a set for March. In April, the job
will overwrite the set from January.</p>
	
	<p>When configuring a rotation the Calendar view displays the schedule
graphically. The interval type for each day is displayed in the calendar.
Clicking on a day in the calendar will display the type of backup,
the write mode, and the name of the media that will be used on that
day. </p><div class="tip" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Tip"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Tip]" height="25" src="images/tip.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>TIP:  </b>You can change the interval for a given day of a schedule by
right-clicking on the day in the calendar and selecting the desired
type. </p><p>You can prevent the job from running on a given day. This is
helpful for times when you know the job won't complete because you
won't be able to supply the right media for the job &#8212; as in
the case of holidays.</p>
	
	<p>You can enable or disable jobs from running on specified days
of the week by clicking the name of the day in the heading of the
calendar view. For example, if you want daily backups on Saturdays.</p>

for Restoring Data</h2><p>Intervals also define the granularity of the data you can restore.
Rotations are set up to capture more granularity in the recent past
and less granularity as data gets older. Larger intervals, like Yearly
and Monthly, produce lower granularity data history. Smaller intervals,
like Daily, produce higher granularity history. Take, for example,
a rotation with three full monthly backup sets on the last day of
each month, four full weekly backup sets created on each Friday, and
four incremental daily backup sets created Monday through Thursday.
Now suppose you have a critical file that changes daily. On Wednesday,
you are asked to retrieve the file as of a specific date. With this
rotation you can roll back to the Monday and Tuesday versions of the
file in the current week and the Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday versions
of the file in the previous week. Beyond that, you will only have
the versions of the file as they existed on Friday for the previous
four weeks previous to the current week. And beyond that you will
only have the versions of the file that existed on the last day of
the month for the previous three months.</p>
	
	<p>The catalog keeps track of the files and versions that have
been backed up so you don't have to remember what media they are on.
This knowledge makes the restoration process very simple. You only
need to specify the files you want restored and Data Protector Express will prompt you for the media it needs restore the files. Full reconstruction
of data may require multiple media sets. For example, to reconstruct
the data for a Wednesday from a GFS 20 set rotation type, you will
require the full backup media set from the previous end of week and
all of the incremental media sets from that week (that is, Mondays,
Tuesdays and Wednesdays). In some circumstances, the preceding full
backup media set will be a monthly or yearly job and not a weekly
job. As long as none of these media sets has been overwritten, full
data recovery is possible.</p>
