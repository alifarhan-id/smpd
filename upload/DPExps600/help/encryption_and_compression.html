	</li></ul></div><h2><a name="encryption"></a>Encryption</h2><p>Encryption is the process of changing data into a
form that cannot be read until it is deciphered, protecting the data
from unauthorized access and use. Company policy normally determines
when encryption is required. </p><div class="informalexample"><p>For example, it may be mandatory for company confidential and
financial data, but not for personal data. Company policy will also
define how encryption keys should be generated and managed.</p>
	
	</div><p>
    </p>
	
	<p>The current version of Data Protector Express provides the user with the ability to encrypt the data that is written
to the media and fully implements the Advanced Encryption Standard
(AES) for both hardware and software encryption. </p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Hardware encryption is supported on some backup devices,
such as HP LTO-4 tape drives. It is faster than software encryption
and requires no processing on the backup server. The encryption strength
is determined by the backup device. HP LTO-4 tape drives always provide
strong AES-256 encryption. This feature can be managed by a backup
application that supports hardware encryption, such as Data Protector Express. </p>
	
	</li><li><p>Software encryption uses the encryption algorithms
available within Data Protector Express. The user
selects an encryption strength: Low 56 bit, Medium 128-bit or High
256-bit. Each encryption key size causes the algorithm to behave slightly
differently. Increasing software encryption strength makes the data
more secure, but requires more processing power.</p>
	
	</li></ul></div><p>If your business requires you to use encryption, Data Protector Express allows you to set the required encryption
types and levels. This chapter contains important information about
data encryption.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="encryption_cryptographic_algorithms"></a>Cryptographic Algorithms</h3><p>Cryptographic algorithms are the basic components of cryptographic
applications. It is important to understand that as you increase the
complexity of the encryption the information gets closer to impossible
to read and the load on your machine, for software-based encryption,
will increase.</p>
	
	<p><b>Software  &nbsp;</b>Three cryptographic algorithms are provided. These three settings
provide three levels of resistance which require progressively more
CPU time to convert the same amount of data. The three options are
for the software encryption mode only.</p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Low &#8211; DES 56-bit</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Medium &#8211; AES 128-bit</p>
	
	</li><li><p>High &#8211; AES 256-bit</p>
	
	</li></ul></div><p><b>Hardware  &nbsp;</b>The cryptographic algorithm provided by hardware devices that
provide this feature is not under Data Protector Express control. The hardware provides configuration and operating parameters
via a special encryption command. The device driver adjusts its crypto
session settings from this input. Hardware encryption is an on/off
feature, you do not have the ability to adjust the encryption level
through the Data Protector Express interface. By
default Data Protector Express will attempt to use
the highest encryption algorithm supported on the device, if the device
supports multiple algorithms. If the device does not support encryption,
the user will be prompted with an alert telling them that the device
cannot be used since it does not support hardware encryption.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="encryption_passphrase"></a>Passphrase</h3><p>The passphrase is a series of characters that must be provided
by the user for input to the cryptographic key generation process. </p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>Passphrases must be no less than 8 logical characters.
They may be created by the user or randomly generated by a separate
application.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>If created by the user, the passphrase should be difficult
to guess and should contain a mix of lowercase/uppercase letters,
digits and special characters. </p>
	
	</li><li><p>The passphrase is one of the components Data Protector Express uses to generate the encryption key.
A longer or random passphrase will increase the strength of the encryption
key even more.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>To aid the user in remembering the passphrase, the
user may enter a hint message. The use of this field is optional and
provided to the user as prompt for remembering the passphrase.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>If a backup job spans multiple media, the same passphrase
will be used for all media in the set.</p>
	
	</li></ul></div><p>Passphrases for the media are stored in the Data Protector Express catalog. This means the user is able to read and append to the encrypted
media without being prompted for a passphrase as long as it is being
accessed by the instance of Data Protector Express that first encrypted it </p>
	
	<p>Once a media is deleted or exported from the Data Protector Express catalog the passphrase is also deleted. There are two instances
when the user needs to know the passphrase:</p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>When importing the media to another machine or another
instance of Data Protector Express</p>
	
	</li><li><p>During disaster recovery</p>
	
	</li></ul></div><div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Caution"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Caution]" height="25" src="images/caution.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>CAUTION: </b>Managing the passphrase is a critical component of any encryption
system. Data may be stored for months or years, so passphrases must
be archived securely. The user should keep a record or backup of encryption
passphrases and store them in a secure place separate from the computer
running Data Protector Express. If the user is unable
to supply the passphrase when requested to do so, neither the user
nor Data Protector Express Support will be able
to access the encrypted data.</p></td></tr><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="1"> </td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" height="10">  </td></tr></table></div><h3><a name="encryption_general_use"></a>Encryption
Options</h3><p>Encryption is enabled on the job&#8217;s <span class="bold"><b>Encryption</b></span> page.</p>
	
	<p><b>Off  &nbsp;</b>Both hardware and software encryption are disabled.</p>
	
	<p><b>Automatic  &nbsp;</b>This selection will use hardware encryption, if it is available
from the device; otherwise, software encryption will be used</p>
	
	<p><b>Software   &nbsp;</b>Software encryption will be used. When <span class="bold"><b>Software </b></span>is selected, the user can choose the strength
of software encryption </p>
	
	<p><b>Hardware  &nbsp;</b>Hardware encryption will be used, if the device supports it.
If it does not support encryption and this option is selected, the
user will be prompted with an alert stating that the device cannot
be used since it does not support hardware encryption. </p>
	
	<p><b>Software Strength  &nbsp;</b>Options for the software encryption strength are listed below
as three selections, low, medium and high. <span class="bold"><b>Low</b></span> is the easiest method to decipher by outside methods, <span class="bold"><b>High</b></span> is the hardest method to decipher by outside
methods. As you progress from low to high, the encryption algorithm
requires more CPU computations for each block of data to be encrypted,
which may slow down the data stream to the device and will increase
CPU loading on the Media Server. </p>
	
	<p><b>Encryption passphrase / Verify Passphrase  &nbsp;</b>The user supplied portion of the encryption key. Data Protector Express will use this value, along with other
information it generates, to calculate an encryption key for the media.
The passphrase must be entered twice to minimize the change of making
a mistake while typing.</p>
	
	<p><b>Hint  &nbsp;</b>The text entered here will be added to the log file of an import
job if the media later needs to be imported and the incorrect passphrase
is supplied. Use this field to create a reminder of the passphrase
as Data Protector Express cannot recover a lost
passphrase.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="key_management"></a>Key Management</h2><p>Data Protector Express has adopted
a very simple key management strategy. A media is encrypted originally
by configuring the job that creates it according to the parameters
described above. From that point on, the media is known to the catalog.
As long as the media is known, restore jobs may use the media without
entering the passphrase again. If a media is unknown &#8212; because
it was deleted from the catalog or because it came from a different
catalog &#8212; you must import the media to make it known to the
catalog again. The import process required you to supply the passphrase
to complete the import. If the passphrase supplied does not match
that used to encrypt the media, then the hint supplied at encryption
time will be shown in the job log so you can try the import again.</p>
	
	<p>When media is encrypted the media is depicted on
the <span><strong class="guilabel">Jobs and Media</strong></span> view with a lock on it. The
Platinum colored lock indicates hardware, whereas the gold lock indicates
software encryption. The Media details window shows the type of encryption
used.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="compression"></a>Compression</h2><p>Software encryption disables hardware compression,
although you will still be able to select <span class="bold"><b>Software
compression.</b></span> </p>
	
	<p>If the backup device has hardware compression then performance
will  be better if only hardware compression is used, and that there
is little  to no benefit of having both enabled. Enabling software
compression in this circumstance will reduce performance.</p>
	
	<p>If <span class="bold"><b>Hardware</b></span> encryption
is selected, we recommend that <span class="bold"><b>Enable hardware
compression</b></span> is also selected. Hardware encryption and hardware
compression can be used on devices, such as the HP LTO-4 tape drive
without any loss of backup speed.</p>
