	<h2><a name="backup_schedule"></a>Schedule Settings</h2><p>The <span><strong class="guilabel">Schedule Settings</strong></span> box contains several
settings that control when jobs are run and how the jobs use media. </p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e1723"></a>Schedule Type</h3><p>This setting is the first step in choosing when the job will
run. Once scheduled, the Data Protector Express service
will ensure the job is started. If one or more job runs are missed
because the service is not running at the scheduled time, the service
will determine the backup mode with the largest interval setting (Daily,
Weekly, Monthly, Yearly) that was missed and run it.</p>
	
	<p><b>Not scheduled  &nbsp;</b>The job will be run manually by the user when desired.</p>
	
	<p><b>Run on selected days  &nbsp;</b>The job will run only on a selected day (or days) at a specified
time. When this option is selected an additional setting, <span><strong class="guilabel">Scheduled Dates</strong></span>, will appear.</p>
	
	<p><b>Run repeatedly  &nbsp;</b>The job will run on a regular interval. Use this setting to
set up a job with media rotation. When this option is selected an
additional set of options, <span><strong class="guilabel">Interval Settings</strong></span>,
will appear. For more information see <a href="rotations.html" title="Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management"><i>Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management</i></a>.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e1750"></a>Start Time</h3><p>This setting is only visible for jobs that will be run on a
schedule. It specifies the time of day that the job should start.
For jobs that are scheduled to run more than once, all runs will happen
at the same time of day.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e1754"></a>Rotation Type and Sets</h3><p>This setting is only available when the job is scheduled
to run repeatedly. The <span><strong class="guilabel">Rotation type</strong></span> and <span><strong class="guilabel">Sets</strong></span> controls allow you to specify a set of preconfigured
rotations. The Custom Rotation type is a special case. It unlocks
the user interface to allow the user to configure his own rotation.
For more information about setting up rotations, see <a href="rotations.html" title="Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management"><i>Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management</i></a>.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e1766"></a>Type of Fixed Rotation</h3><p>This setting is only available when creating a custom rotation.
For more information about setting up rotations, see <a href="rotations.html" title="Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management"><i>Scheduling, Rotations, and Media Management</i></a>.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="backup_modes"></a>Mode Settings</h2><p>The <span><strong class="guilabel">Mode</strong></span> box contains several settings
the control the type of backup and automatic verify that will be performed,
how used media will be treated, and what to do when a file won't fit
on the current media. Man of these settings are set automatically
when a schedule rotation is in effect. When a rotation controls theses
settings they become disabled in the Administrator.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e1779"></a>Backup mode</h3><p>
        <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1783"></a>   <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1789"></a>Data Protector Express supports the back modes listed below. For scheduled automatic rotation
jobs, Data Protector Express uses the backup mode
for each backup set as indicated on the <span><strong class="guimenu">Schedule</strong></span> page; for unscheduled or manual jobs, Data Protector Express uses the settings set by the user. </p>
	
	<p><b>Full  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to back up all selected files. </p>
	
	<p><b>Differential  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to back up all selected files that have changed since the <span class="italic">last full</span>
          <span class="bold"><b> </b></span>backup. </p>
	
	<p><b>Incremental  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to back up all selected files that have changed since the <span class="italic">last</span> full, differential, or incremental backup. </p>
	
	<p><b>Copy  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to back up <span class="italic">all</span> selected files, but it has no
effect on any future scheduled job. Use this option when you wish
to make a record of files or systems at a particular time, but do
not wish to disrupt the normal backup schedule.</p>
	
	<div class="caution" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Caution"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Caution]" height="25" src="images/caution.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>CAUTION: </b>Incremental jobs<a class="indexterm" name="d0e1833"></a> are the shortest and smallest jobs to run, but they present
some issues related to full data recovery. The difference between
an incremental and a differential backup is important -- incremental
backup jobs back up only files that have changed since the last full,
differential or incremental backup, while differential backup jobs
back up all files changed since the last <span class="italic">full</span> backup. If incremental backup media sets are overwritten or recycled
before another full backup is performed, this can create a gap in
available data if you need to recover files from the overwritten media. </p><p>Exclusive use of incremental backup jobs to ensure
full data recovery after a disaster is not recommended, <span class="italic">unless you are using a schedule that retains one full
backup and all subsequent incremental backups </span>before overwriting
any media. However, to ensure successful data recovery with incremental
jobs, follow these guidelines:</p>
	
	<p>Have at least as many incremental media as there
are days between full or differential backup jobs. For example, if
you run full backup jobs every five days, have at least four incremental
media; if you run full backup jobs every seven days, have at least
six incremental media.</p>
	
	<p>Never recycle incremental media between differential
or full backup jobs. If you run more than one incremental job in a
row, be certain to not recycle any of the media used during this string
of incremental jobs.</p>

        <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1855"></a>After Data Protector Express backs up a set of data, it can verify that the data was backed up
correctly. Data Protector Express reads the files
from the media and performs the selected verification type. If any
discrepancies between the two files are found, the file is reported
in the job log.</p>
	
	<p><b>Full Verify  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to compare every selected file stored on the media with the original
file from the PC desktop or file or application server. If the file
has changed since it was backed up, the full verify process will report
that the file on the media does not match the file on disk. This does
not mean that the backup was unsuccessful.</p>
	
	<p><b>Quick Verify  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to be certain that every file backed up onto the media is in readable
condition. It does not verify that the data matches the file, only
that the data stored on the media can be read.</p>
	
	<p><b>No Verify  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to skip the verification step. It is not recommended.</p>

        <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1883"></a>For automatic rotation jobs, Data Protector Express overwrites all media. For other jobs, Data Protector Express uses the write mode settings set by the
user. This mode determines whether the old data on the media is <span class="italic">overwritten</span> with new data or whether the new data is <span class="italic">appended</span> to the end of the old data. When media is overwritten,
all of the data previously stored on it is lost. Appending data will
preserve the old data. </p>
	
	<p><b>Append to all media  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to append all data to the end of the media. No data is overwritten.
Select this setting for permanent storage.</p>
	
	<p><b>Append to first media, overwrite others  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to append data to the end of the first media, but to overwrite all
media that follows. For example, Data Protector Express will not overwrite the first media inserted, but will overwrite
the second, third and later media. This setting is useful if you have
a set of media with old data you no longer need. By selecting this
option, Data Protector Express preserves your most
recent data on the first media, but overwrites older, unneeded media.</p>
	
	<p><b>Overwrite all media  &nbsp;</b>This setting instructs Data Protector Express to overwrite all media. All data on media that is overwritten is
lost. Use this option for media that are going to be recycled.</p>

        <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1914"></a>   <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1920"></a>The Split File mode determines
how Data Protector Express will handle a file if
the file is too large to fit on the current media. Selecting this
option to instruct Data Protector Express to split
a file across two media if it will not fit on the current backup media.
If this option is not selected then file that don't fit on the media
will be restarted on the next media. </p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><table border="0" cellspacing="1" cellpadding="0" summary="Warning"><tr><td> </td><td bgcolor="#555555" height="3"> </td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2" align="center" valign="top" width="25"><img alt="[Warning]" height="25" src="images/warning.gif"></td><th align="left"></th></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><p><b>WARNING! </b>If you use the split file option, files that span two media
