	</li></ul></div><p>Recovering from a catastrophic disaster can be a time and labor
intensive task. Typically new hardware must be acquired and installed.
The environment of the machine, including the operating system and
applications, needs to be restored to the new hardware. Only then
can backed up data be restored. You can configure your regular backups
so you can accomplish disaster recovery from your backup media, quickly
and easily, using theData Protector Express Bare
Metal Disaster Recovery (BMDR) agent. </p>
	
	<p>The BMDR agent recovers your machine by booting it from bootable
media, repartitioning its disks, and then restoring the machine&#8217;s
data. Bootable media, or boot images, which include a minimal OS,
device drivers, and your backup software, are created by properly
configuring your regular backup. During a backup of your system, you
can create a boot image of any machine in the backup, save or update
the boot image in the catalog, save the ISO to a file, or burn the
boot image (of the media server) to the beginning of your backup media.</p>
	
	<p>While you need boot media of your Backup Server on hand for
disaster recovery, for all other machines in your backup domain, an
updated boot image which can be burned to media, along with fully
backed up data, is sufficient preparation for disaster recovery.</p>
	
	<p>Once the machine boots, you can restore your backup data from
a locally attached backup device, or for clients running supported
Operating Systems, the restore can be run over the network. Some final
steps to restore third party data and any incremental or differential
backups complete the recovery of the machine. </p>
	
	<p>To effectively use the BMDR agent you must prepare for disaster
and test your preparations periodically.</p>
	
	<h2><a name="important_guidelines"></a>Important guidelines</h2><p>Disaster Recovery of a Backup Server requires bootable media
on hand to start the disaster recovery process. Once the Backup Server
boots, its data can be restored from backup media loaded in an attached
device. All data on the media will be restored. </p>
	
	<p>Disaster recovery of clients in the Backup Domain also requires
bootable media. which can be created at disaster recovery time from
up to date boot images stored in the catalog. Use Make bootable CD/DVD
from the Task menu on the Backup Administrator, to burn the stored
boot image of any client to CD/DVD, or to create a file of the ISO
image which can be burned to media using third party software. </p>
	
	<p>Once you boot a client, you can restore data from a locally
attached device loaded with your backup data (all data on the backup
media will be restored), or for client machines with supported Operating
Systems, you can choose Network Disaster Recovery. Network Disaster
Recovery allows you to configure a restore job, selecting the data
you wish to restore using the Backup Administrator, and restoring
data over the network.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e6889"></a>Boot Media</h3><p>Boot images must be written at the beginning of media, so they
must be written to blank media, or must overwrite existing media.
To create a bootable image for disaster recovery, you should select
the Write Mode <span><strong class="guilabel">Overwrite all media</strong></span> on the backup
job&#8217;s Configuration page Settings. Data Protector Express then writes system configuration information to the backup media
in support of disaster recovery making the media bootable. </p>
	
	<h4><a name="d0e6896"></a>When to create new bootable media</h4><p>
      <a class="indexterm" name="d0e6900"></a>You should keep bootable
media on hand for every machine which may require disaster recovery. </p>
	
	<p>Your bootable media may become <span class="italic">obsolete</span> whenever any of the following occurs:</p>
	
	<div class="orderedlist"><ol type="1"><li><p>Add or remove hardware from your computer.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Change firmware or update device drivers.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Change your disk drive configuration (e.g., modify
volumes or partitions).</p>
	
	</li></ol></div><p>You should create new bootable media in any of the above cases.</p>
	
	<h3><a name="d0e6923"></a>Restoring to dissimilar hardware</h3><p>When performing disaster recovery, the hardware on the target
system must be nearly identical to the source system with the following
exceptions:</p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>You may change your video adapter as long as the new
video adapter is VGA compatible.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>You may increase the size of your hard disk.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Your SCSI, ATAPI, Fibre Channel or USB tape drive
and adapter <span class="italic">must be the same or use the same driver</span> as it did when the disaster recovery media was created.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>Your SCSI, IDE, Fibre Channel or USB tape drive and
adapter must be the same or use the same driver as it did when the
disaster recovery media was created.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>You may change network cards, USB ports and USB peripherals, <span class="italic">except</span> tape drives, without restriction.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
          <span class="italic">You may not perform disaster recovery to
a USB hard drive</span>
          <span class="italic"> or to Fibre Channel devices</span>
          <span class="italic">.</span> </p>
	
	</li></ul></div><p>Disaster recovery allows device drivers to be added during a
recovery in the event that hardware changes require additional drivers.
Changing processors, motherboards, or other hardware components, will
not prevent disaster recovery from working. </p>
	
	<h3><a name="dr_advantage_of_bootable_devices"></a>The Advantage of Bootable Backup Devices</h3><p>Certain devices, bootable backup devices, allow you to create
bootable media at backup time. The boot image is written directly
to the beginning of the backup media, prepending the backed up data.
Disaster Recovery with bootable media created this way is simplified
because the backup media provides the boot image of the machine being
recovered and the data, which is restored when the machine is booted
with it.</p>
	
	<p>If you create a backup to a bootable backup device that supports
bootable media, as long as your backup is written from the beginning
of the media, the media will be bootable and can be used for Bare-Metal
Disaster Recovery. </p>
	
	<p>Bootable backup devices that support bootable media and bare-metal
recovery include:</p>
	
	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>tape drives that support HP One-Button Disaster Recovery
technology (see description below) and</p>
	
	</li><li><p>removable cartridge disk drives.</p>
	
	</li></ul></div><p>Removable cartridge disk drives support the creation of bootable
media with both the boot image and the backed up data, as do tape
drives with One-Button Disaster Recovery (OBDR). OBDR is a firmware
feature which enables a tape drive to act like a bootable CD-ROM in
Disaster Recovery mode. When you create a backup on an OBDR tape drive
to new media, or select the Write Mode Overwrite all media (on the
backup job&#8217;s configuration settings page), Data Protector Express automatically makes the media bootable. When you run One-Button
Disaster Recovery, your tape drive goes into a special Disaster Recovery
mode that enables it to restore your operating system, reboot from
the most recent backup cartridge, and restore the backup data from
the media.</p>
