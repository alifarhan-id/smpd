vital data. Each <span class="italic">machine</span> that will
be protected must have Data Protector Express installed. One machine acts as the Backup Server which
houses the <span class="italic">catalog</span> and establishes
a Backup	 Domain. Other machines become <span class="italic">clients</span> of the Backup	 Domain by identifying themselves as clients of
the Backup Server during installation. </p>
	
	<p>Data Protector Express can back up data from
clients over a network to a backup device attached to a remote machine. A client with an attached device acts as a <span class="italic">Media Server</span>. </p>
	
	<p>When a machine is being backed up or restored it is operating
the client role. When it is providing access to a backup device it
is operating as a Media Server. And when a machine is hosting the
catalog it is operating as the Backup Server. A
single machine can operate in one or more roles at the same time.</p>
	
	<p>Data on client machines is read and written with <span class="italic">agents</span> such as the File System, Windows System
State, Microsoft SQL, and Microsoft Exchange agents. The configuration
of agents is done on a client by client basis.</p>
	
	<p>A typical installation of Data Protector Express may look like Figure 1 below.</p>

	<div class="itemizedlist"><ul type="disc"><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Clients</span>&#8212; A client is any
computer (or <span class="italic">Machine</span>) in the Backup	 Domain other than
the Backup Server. This includes file servers, application servers, and user PCs (desktops
and laptops). All client computers must have Data Protector Express installed. For licensing purposes, clients are classified as being <span class="italic">server</span> or <span class="italic">workstation</span> class machines. All clients are considered to be server class clients
unless they are running Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Backup	 Domain</span>&#8212; A Backup	 Domain is a collection
of computers and backup devices that is managed together as a group.
A Backup	 Domain can encompass an entire company or each department could be a separate
domain, even though they are all on the same network. All resources
in a Backup	 Domain can be accessed by all members of the Backup	 Domain and centrally
managed from a single Data Protector Express interface.
Each file server, application server, user PC, and attached peripherals
such as backup devices can be the member of only one Backup	 Domain. Each Backup	 Domain has one
and only one Backup Server.</p>

administer more than one Backup	 Domain from a single computer. However, the Data Protector Express interface cannot manage more than one Backup	 Domain at the same
time. The administrator must log off of one Backup	 Domain and log
into another.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Backup Server</span>&#8212; Each Backup	 Domain has one and only one Backup Server.  The Backup Server is
responsible for coordinating the backup activities of all other machines
in the Backup	 Domain. All license information is also contained on the Backup Server.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Catalog</span>&#8212;
A catalog is a special-purpose database that contains all the information
about a Backup	 Domain. There is one and only one catalog for each Backup	 Domain. The catalog
must reside on the Backup Server machine.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Job</span>&#8212; A job
is an object stored in the catalog that represents the settings for
a task the user has configured. Jobs come in one of four types: backup,
restore, verify, and copy media.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Backup devices</span>&#8212;
A backup device is any device to which files can be backed up. This
includes tape drives, tape libraries, hard disks (as virtual tape
libraries), and Network Attached Storage (NAS) appliances. Backup
devices are attached to media servers. Each Backup	 Domain must have
at least one backup device, such as a tape device, tape library, virtual
library, or CD device. This backup device can belong to only one Backup	 Domain; it cannot
be shared among multiple domains. However, a Backup	 Domain could have
multiple backup devices.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Media Server</span>&#8212;
A media server is any machine in the Backup	 Domain to which
a backup device is attached. Any machine in the Backup	 Domain can act
as a media server. There can be multiple media servers in a Backup	 Domain. The media
server allows its attached backup devices to be shared by all the
machines in the same Backup	 Domain</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Media</span>&#8212; Backed
up files are written to media.  Media can be a physical tape or a
virtual &#8220;tape&#8221; in a virtual tape library on a disk drive.
Media cannot be used in another Backup	 Domain without
importing the media into the other Backup	 Domain. </p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Media Rotation</span> &#8212;
Rotations are a means of efficiently using you available media to
maintain data history. When using a rotation your backups alternate
among a set of multiple media, reusing older media when necessary.
The type of media rotation you select is based on how often you want
to back up your data, how long you want to retain the data, and the
number of media you want to use.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Disaster Recovery</span> (DR) &#8212; Disaster Recovery is the process of restoring a machine
that has suffered a catastrophic failure such as hardware failure
or critical system data loss. The recovery process entails reformatting
the affected system's hard drive and restoring the operating system,
system settings, applications, and data from a backup. This feature
replaces the traditional tedious task of finding installation disks,
installing operating systems and applications, patching them and restoring
data with a simple restore process directly from backups.</p>
	
	</li><li><p>
            <span class="italic">Full System Recovery</span> &#8212; Full system recovery is the process of recovering all of
the data on a machine. It differs from DR in that a full system recovery
does not reformat the disks prior to restoring the data.</p>
